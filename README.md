**LinkSphere ‚Äì Secure and Smart URL Shortener**

LinkSphere is a full-stack URL shortening platform focused on efficiency, security, and privacy. Unlike traditional shorteners, it prevents duplicate links, blocks malicious URLs, and keeps link analytics private to the creator. It also includes an auto-expiry system to clean up unused links and is designed with future support for user accounts and personalized dashboards.

üìå How It Works
User submits a long URL on the homepage.

The server checks if a short version already exists for that URL.

If it doesn't exist, the URL is validated using the Safe Browsing API.

If safe, a unique short ID is generated and stored in the database.

Visiting the short URL redirects the user to the original link and updates click count.

If unused for 7 days, the URL is automatically removed from the database.
